<br />
<p>It, sadly, appears one of our disclosed administrator was social engineered into releasing the telnet password.  The following offender, <a href="http://pastebin.com/DJiLenX3">Ivanmorgan</a>, logged into as a highly rank administrator and tricked him to promote him.   Once classified as "Senior Administrator" he threatened to permanently suspend him if he did not provide the password.   The administrator sadly did release the password, however, due to Ivan having a past record of abusing he was already blocked from connecting.</p>
<br />
<center><h3>Prevention</h3></center>
<p>To prevent Ivan or any other member from connecting using the compromised password we've decided to change our password, port and remove the administrators from having the telnet password.</p> 
<br />
<center><h3>I still don't understand, what happened?</h3></center>
<p>Well, truly nothing for our members..   No userdata was compromised, no personally identifiable information was compromised..  The only information Ivan obtained was an old password and old port..   Basically, Ivan decided to grief our server and attempted to obtain telnet access..   Nothing truly to worry about.</p>
